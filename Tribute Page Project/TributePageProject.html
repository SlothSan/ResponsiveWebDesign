       <h3 id="headline">The Life Of Marcus Aurelius</h3>
        <section id=tribute-info>
                 <p>Marcus Aurelius was one of the most revered Roman Emperors who believed in placing his empire before everything else in his life. To date, his name is well-maintained in antiquity. An eager follower of Stoicism, his philosophical ideals and writings were all compiled and preserved in a dairy for over ten years, which is known to the world today as ‘Meditations’. At a time when battle and malady destabilized the Roman empire from all sides, Aurelius made sure that he was every bit the emperor his people wanted him to be, by protecting them from the callousness of the Germans and the Parthians. As a young boy, it is believed that this powerful leader was in fact, an earnest child and took to music, drama, literature, the sciences and geometry to keep himself busy. In his youth, he studied philosophy with fervor for the next couple of decades and also developed an interest in law, which earned him the position of the leader of the senate. During his reign as the emperor, he fought the northern nemeses along with his brother, Verus and son, Commodus and began to expand his empire’s borders despite all the war pandemonium. Today, he is remembered for his writings, reflective nature and his statute driven by cause.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>26 April 121 CE</strong> - Marcus Aurelius (Titus Aurelius Antoninus) was born into a wealthy prominent family in Rome Italy. He was extremely bright as a young boy and was a dedicated student, tutored by many private educators.

He was passionate about literature, music, Latin and Greek, but took great interest and absorbed himself in the works of the Stoic philosopher, Epictetus, who had a great influence over the Roman emperor’s ideologies from very early on. This sort of intellectual dedication was noticed by the-then emperor, Hadrian.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>138 CE</strong> - After Hadrian’s former choice of heir passed away, he adopted Titus Aurelius Antoninus to succeed him as emperor. Hadrian also organized for Antoninus to embrace and take young Aurelius under his wing at the age of 17.

Thus, he lived and worked closely with his adopted father, while learning the ways of political and public affairs.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>140 CE</strong> - Aurelius became emissary, or leader of the senate—a post he would hold twice in his life. As the years passed, he was given more political errands and official powers and thus, he slowly progressed into a sturdy source of backing and guidance for Antoninus, his father.

              During this time, he also continued to study philosophy and harbored an interest in law. </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>161 CE</strong> - he rose to power and was officially known as ‘Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus’.

While many documents suggest that he was the emperor’s only successor, Aurelius is believed to have insisted that his adopted brother, Lucius Aurelius Verus Augustus, also serve as the co-ruler </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Mid to Late 160s CE</strong> - Unlike the nonviolent reign of their father, Antoninus, the joint sovereignty of the two brothers was dotted with countless bloody wars and plagues. Through the mid and late 160s, the brothers combated the Parthians for control of lands in the East.

Verus, his brother, supervised the war struggle, while Aurelius managed their empire back home. Much of their victory in this battle has been credited to the generals employed under Verus, particularly Avidius Cassius. The soldiers, who returned from war back to Rome, carried with them a number of lethal illnesses, which destroyed nearly half the population of Rome</li>
<br>
            <li><strong>Late 160s CE</strong> - Aurelius and his brother clashed with the German tribes in the late 160s.This was after the tribes crossed the Danube river and attacked a Roman city.

Following the sudden death of his brother, Verus (possibly due to an illness), in 169 CE, Aurelius continued the battle with his troops, fighting the Germans back from the border.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>175 CE</strong> - his position as the emperor was challenged by none other than Avidius Cassius. While Aurelius was away combating the Germans, rumors were rife that that he had become seriously ill. Seizing the opportunity, Cassius claimed the title of emperor for himself.

This forced Aurelius to travel back to Rome to regain control; however, he never had to confront Cassius himself, as the general was slain by his own soldiers. Thus, he got back to traveling the eastern regions with his wife, re-establishing control in every city he set foot in.</li>
            <br>
                        <li><strong>170-180 CE</strong> - Aurelius wrote ‘Meditations’ a philosophical text. The book itself was first published in 1558 in Zurich and the only remaining copy can be found in the Vatican library.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>177 CE</strong> - Aurelius made his son, Commodus, his co-ruler. They fought the German tribes and also tussled with the northern enemies of the empire, while trying to extend the empire’s geographical borders.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>17 March 180 CE</strong> - He passed away in Vindobona (Vienna), his ashes were taken back to Rome. His son, Commodus, succeeded his father as the emperor. In 410, his battles against the Germans were memorialized by a pillar and a shrine in Rome.</li>
<br>
<p id="footer"><strong>Following his death, he earned the title of philosopher-king; a title that still exists today.</strong></p>
